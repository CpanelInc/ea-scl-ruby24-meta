Package %{scl_name} provides the Ruby language as a Software
Collection.  For more information about Software Collections, see
scl(1).  By installing the %{scl_name} collection, you will get a
minimal set of packages to have a working Ruby installation.

Usage: scl enable %{scl} 'ruby'

Software Collections allows use of applications which are not located
in the filesystem root hierarchy but are present in an alternative
location, which is %{_scl_root} in case of the %{scl_name}
collection.

Ruby is the interpreted scripting language for quick and easy
object-oriented programming.  It has many features to process text
files and to do system management tasks (as in Perl).  It is simple,
straight-forward, and extensible.

When working with %{scl_name} collection, use the "scl" utility (see
scl(1) for usage) to enable the scl environment properly.

Configuration for the %{scl_name} software collection is located under %{_sysconfdir}.

Examples:
scl enable %{scl_name} 'command --arg'
  Run a specific command with argument --arg within %{scl_name} software collections
  environment.

scl enable %{scl_name} 'ruby'
  Run ruby from %{scl_name} software collection.

scl enable %{scl_name} bash
  Run interactive shell where %{scl_name} software collection is enabled.

scl enable %{scl_name} 'man ruby'
  Show man pages for ruby command, which is part of the %{scl_name} software
  collection.
